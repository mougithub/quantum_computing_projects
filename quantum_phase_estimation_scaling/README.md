This repository implements Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) using Qiskit and analyzes how estimation accuracy scales with the number of counting qubits.
- QPE circuit construction
- Inverse Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)
- Conversion to estimated phase values and comprison
- Error in phase estimation plotted versus number of counting qubits
- Results consistent with theoretical bounds
